## About

One-handed keyboard designed for individuals with limb loss or limited hand function.

Conditions in which this keyboard can be useful include:

- hemiplegia
- blindness (reading a braille screen with one hand while typing with the other hand)
- as well as other conditions where typing with only one hand is required

Currently working on [v1](./src/v1/)
